# Mac-Battery
a little widget for me to log my mac battery over time and use discord to alert me when it's low and needs to charge.

I created this because sometimes I thought my mac battery was sufficiently charged when in fact it was not. This way if my mac is low and I'm home it'll alert me through discord

## DIY
1. download the python file
2. configure a cron job for time interval (mine is every 5)
3. set the environment variables
  Note: I use google sheets for mine (I was experimenting with an alternative db) so feel free to use a sql db
4. done!
